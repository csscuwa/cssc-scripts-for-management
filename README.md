# CSSC Scripts & Other Goodies

We are Computer Scientists, this means we occasionally get on the computer and make stuff.

Sometimes we want to show off a little and/or want to put this up so others can look at it and help

## cssc-events-script

### Originally Written By:

### Description
Early work on writing a script that can be used to update the RSS file for the clubs events.

It was originally going to be a php page that committee could log into and modify, but I have mostly given up on php development so that's a thing.

This is just a quick and dirty python script I'm in the process of writing so that the events page can be updated without directly touching the xml file itself
